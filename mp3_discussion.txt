		
Voting Sets:
	- The voting set was taken from creating a 3x3 matrix consisting of the node ids. A node's set consists of the nodes in the intersecting row and column
	1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
	2: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
	3: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9]
	4: [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
	5: [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]
	6: [3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
	7: [1, 4, 7, 8, 9]
	8: [2, 5, 7, 8, 9]
	9: [3, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Deadlock Avoidance:

	In order to avoid deadlocks, the use of timestamp was employed in addition to using "Inquire", "Yield" and "failed" messages.

	Whenever a node receives a request with higher priority than the request it already responded to, then it sends an "inquire" message to the voted node as an attempt to take its vote back.
	The voted node will "yield"/return the vote if it has received any "failed" messages from the other voters. 
	Also, the voted node will yield its vote if the replacing node has a lower timestamp or lower id if they have equal timestamps.
	All the un-responded requests are queued and responded to later.
